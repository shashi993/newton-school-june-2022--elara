Homework:
	* Practice flexbox 
		- Create a google-photos type of layout with many different boxes of the same height and 
		different widths arranged horizontally (you don't need to use actual images. Just boxes.)
		- Create a webpage with multiple boxes stacked on top of each other, and they overflow to 
		the next line if we reduce the height of the page.
